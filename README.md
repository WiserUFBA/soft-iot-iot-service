# FoT-Gateway-IoT-Service

The FoT-Gateway-IoT-Service exposes sensor data of IoT system through a RESTful Web Service. It accesses data stored in local database, managed by [fot-gateway-local-storage](https://github.com/WiserUFBA/fot-gateway-local-storage), allowing users get data and information about sensors in JSON format.

This module depends of modules [fot-gateway-mapping-devices](https://github.com/WiserUFBA/fot-gateway-mapping-devices) and [fot-gateway-local-storage](https://github.com/WiserUFBA/fot-gateway-local-storage). They need to be installed and started before FoT-Gateway-IoT-Service.
